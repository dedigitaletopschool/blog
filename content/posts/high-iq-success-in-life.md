> “If you are skeptical of the claim that a high IQ is not sufficient for success in life, just visit a meeting of an elite high-IQ society such as MENSA, the Four Sigma Society, or the Mega Society. Those who join such organizations are often unemployed misfits who have no other professional organization to join. Their high IQs are their only claim to self-esteem.”
