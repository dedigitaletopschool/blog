This blog is managed with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Local blogging

``` shell
hugo server # start the local webserver
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md # regular old post
hugo new aanbevelings/obs-de-regenboog-maastricht.md # for a recommendation
```

## Deployment

Push to `master` and [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) takes it from there.

Not sure if your work is ready for production yet? Push to a branch and Netlify deploys a separate website for that branch. Magical!
